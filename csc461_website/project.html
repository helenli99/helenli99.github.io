        <p>This page shows some detail information of our project.We have already
           started our research, and we bulid and train the Picar-B
        by using applications and coding. Meanwhile, we record the whole process, check and solve the challenge we met, and then write the weekly
      report shown in following:</p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Weekly Report One:</b>
          <p>Our purpose is to understand how the multimedia system can use in
            our real world and use technology in our daily life special in vehicles.
            Firstly, we need to do some basic research on which multimedia system
            is using on the Picar, and to understand how the system is used for
            the robot car. </p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Weekly Report Two:</b>
          <p>We bought the Picar from Amazon, and before we install the software
            and build the system we must assemble the Picar completely and test
            it to make sure everything is assembled correctly.</p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Weekly Report Three:</b>
          <p>This week we need to install that support application and python
            library on both computers. For example, we need to install OpenCV
            and Numpy library to let the Picar allow us to write a function that
            makes the camera track the object and detecting the real-world environment. </p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Weekly Report Four:</b>
          <p>This week we test out the ultrasonic sensor and use it to control
            the Picar keep in a good distance between the object and itself.</p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Weekly Report Five:</b>
          <p>This week we try to use the camera and OpenCV to track the object
            and control the Picar to follow the object.</p>

          <p>This video shows demonstration of PiCar. We introduced the background
            information and code details in this video and we hope you
            can enjoy this video! To watch it, please click "Click me" button.</p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Support Code:</b>
          <p>This code is provided by Adeept Company. And it supports mainframe
            programming of Python code and a precise GUI program.</p>
            <a class="button" href="file/Adeept_PiCar-B-V1.1.zip" target="_blank">Check it</a>
          <p>This code is created and modified by our team. And this code is to
            use LED light to simulate Morsa code.</p>

        <li><b style=font-size:19px>Final Report:</b>
          <p>This final report shows whole prcess of our research, and all findings
          after exploring PiCar. We also hope that the comparison and analysis
          of different obstacle detection methods can help us to get a deep understanding of
          obstacle avoidance techniques for the autonomous driving model.</p>
